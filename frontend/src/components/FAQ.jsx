      question: 'What is the significance of henna? Why should I get henna?',
      answer: 'Henna has been used to adorn bodies as part of traditional and holiday celebrations for many years now. In many cultures, it is regarded as a blessing, and applied for luck as well as joy and beauty. There are various stories and folk lores. In India, it is said that the deeper the colour of a brideâ€™s henna stain color, the more her husband (some say mother-in-law) will love her!',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is the process painful? How does it compare to getting a tattoo?',

    },
    {
      question: 'Is henna applied only on the hands and feet?',
      answer: 'While henna is traditionally applied to the hands and feet, it can be applied to other parts of the body as well.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long is the application process?',
      answer: 'The application process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the complexity and size of the design.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I get an amazing henna stain?',
      answer: 'To get a deep, dark henna stain, ensure that the paste is of good quality, the application is done correctly, and the paste is left on the skin for the recommended time.',
